# BookPriceFinder

Built a web service on the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack to scrape and cache the prices of books from several popular
retailers like Flipkart, Infibeam and Homeshop18 in India to create an Android application that can scan the barcode on a book and
fetch the various prices at which it is offered from online retailers.
